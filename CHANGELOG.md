# CHANGELOG

## unreleased

## v0.3.0 2020-12-28

Moved package into `@algorand-builder` NPM organization. So all imports and install commands require to change `algob` to `@algorand-builder/algob`.

* Reproducible, declarative Algorand Network setup using scripts in `/infrastructure`.
* Re-organized examples. Now all examples share same config. Users are able to provide their own
* We ported all developer.algorand reference templates
* Reworked smart contract handling.
* API documentation improvements
* Added lot of new TypeScript [typings](https://github.com/scale-it/algorand-builder/tree/master/packages/types-algosdk) for `algosdk-js`

## v0.2.0 2020-11-25

* As a user I can compile and run PyTeal Files
* As a user I can access accounts from an ENV variable
* As a user I can load ALGOD and KMD credentials from ENV variable
* As a user I can load a multisig directly from /assets and execute transactions
* As a user I can use CLI to run an JS Node REPL with async/await suppport on the top level

### Breaking Changes
