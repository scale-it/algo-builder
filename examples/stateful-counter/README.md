## Stateful Counter Example

We will create a simple stateful smart contract which will:
- Have a global variable `counter`
- Will increment `counter` each time we call the application.

## Steps

+ [Create a file with Approval Program](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/assets/approval_program.teal)
+ [Create a file with Clear program](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/assets/clear_program.teal)
+ [Deploy New Application](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/deploy.js)
+ [Opt-In to Application](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/deploy.js)
+ [Call Application](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/scripts//interaction_scripts/call_application.js)
+ [Update Application](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/interaction_scripts/update_application.js)
+ [Delete Application](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/interaction_scripts/delete_application.js)

# 1. Create a file with Approval Program

We will create an approval program which has global `counter` and it is incremented by 1 each time we call the application. Put the code below in `/assets/approval_program.teal`:

```
#pragma version 2

int NoOp
txn OnCompletion
==

bnz application_call

int 1
return

application_call:

// read global state
byte "counter"
dup
app_global_get

// increment the value
int 1
+

// store to scratch space
dup
store 0

// update global state
app_global_put

// load return value as approval
load 0
return

```

This program has a single global key/value pair to store the number of times the program was called. The key is the string "counter" and the value will be defined as an integer when the application is created.


# 2. Create a file with Clear Program

Now, we will create clear program. This program does not evaluate any conditions and simply approves the call. Put the code below in `/assets/clear_program.teal`:

```
#pragma version 2

int 1
return
```

# 3. Deploy New Application

To deploy the contract use the following code in a new file named `deploy.js` in `scripts` folder of your project directory:

### Create user accounts

```javascript
const masterAccount = deployer.accountsByName.get('master-account');
const creatorAccount = deployer.accountsByName.get('alice');

const algoTxnParams = {
  type: types.TransactionType.TransferAlgo,
  sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
  fromAccount: masterAccount,
  toAccountAddr: creatorAccount.addr,
  amountMicroAlgos: 200e6,
  payFlags: {}
};
// transfer some algos to creator account
await executeTransaction(deployer, algoTxnParams);
```

In the code above we declared user accounts and funded `creatorAccount` account. `masterAccount` is the default account used in algob private net.

### Deploy stateful contract

Firstly we need to fund the contract. `master` account will fund it (as it has lot of algos):

```javascript
// Create Application
// Note: An Account can have maximum of 10 Applications.
const sscInfo = await deployer.deploySSC(
  'approval_program.teal', // approval program
  'clear_program.teal', // clear program
  {
    sender: creatorAccount,
    localInts: 1,
    localBytes: 1,
    globalInts: 1,
    globalBytes: 1
  }, {});

console.log(sscInfo);
```

Parameters passed are:
  - Approval Program
  - Clear Program
  - SSC(stateful smart contract) arguments which includes sender and details for storage usage.
  - Common transaction parameters (eg. totalFee)

- In above code we have deployed a new application.

- After deploying application you should see the following information on your terminal:

```
Created new app-id: 189
{
  creator: 'EDXG4GGBEHFLNX6A7FGT3F6Z3TQGIU6WVVJNOXGYLVNTLWDOCEJJ35LWJY',
  txId: 'BCP3ZKT26K2BEB475OMKQHOMBEFVWEHESRS3XMAWQEVASFP6JFUA',
  confirmedRound: 13899,
  appID: 189
}
```

# 4. Opt-In to Application

To Opt-In to an application use the following code in one of your scripts (in `./scripts`):

```javascript
await deployer.optInAccountToSSC(account, applicationID, {}, {});
```

where `Account` is the account you want to opt-in and applicationID is application index.

# 5. Call Application

To call an application use the following code in one of your scripts (in `./scripts`):

```javascript
const tx = {
  type: types.TransactionType.CallNoOpSSC,
  sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
  fromAccount: creatorAccount,
  appId: applicationID,
  payFlags: {}
}

await executeTransaction(deployer, tx);
```

In `tx` there are following parameters:
  - we set the type which is `CallNoOpSSC` - Call to stateful smart contract
  - set the sign to SecretKey (tx is signed by creatorAccount's sk)
  - provide fromAccount details
  - provide application index of SSC (retreived from checkpoint)
  - provide payment flags, if any (eg. fee, firstValid, lastvalid etc)

Calling application each time will increase the stateful counter by 1.
To view the global state of the application you can use the following code:

```
// Retreive Global State
let globalState = await readGlobalStateSSC(deployer, creatorAccount.addr, applicationID);
console.log(globalState);
```

Output:

```
[ { key: 'Y291bnRlcg==', value: { bytes: '', type: 2, uint: 2 } } ]
[ { key: 'Y291bnRlcg==', value: { bytes: '', type: 2, uint: 3 } } ]
```

here key 'Y291bnRlcg==' is base64 encoded form of `counter`.

# 6. Update Application

To update an application with (new_approval.teal, new_clear.teal), you can use:

```javascript
const updatedRes = await deployer.updateSSC(
  creatorAccount,
  {}, // pay flags
  applicationID,
  'new_approval.teal',
  'new_clear.teal',
  {}
);
console.log('Application Updated: ', updatedRes);
```

# 7. Delete Application

To delete an existing application you can use:

```javascript
const tx = {
  type: types.TransactionType.DeleteSSC,
  sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
  fromAccount: creatorAccount,
  appId: applicationID,
  payFlags: {},
  appArgs: []
}

await executeTransaction(deployer, tx);
```

Note: Deleting non existing app will throw error.
