    https://developer.algorand.org/solutions/example-permissioned-voting-stateful-smart-contract-application/?query=asset%2520contract
    To implement a permissioned voting application on Algorand, a central authority is needed to 
    provide users the right to vote. In this example, this is handled by an Algorand Standard 
    Asset. The central authority creates a vote token and then gives voters who have registered 
    one voting token. The voter then registers within a round range with the voting smart 
    contract, by Opting into the contract. Voters then vote by grouping two transactions. 
    The first is a smart contract call to vote for either candidate A or candidate B, and 
    the second is transferring the vote token back to the central authority. Voting is only
    allowed within the voting range.
