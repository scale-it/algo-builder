    This smart contract acts as a controller of the token. It
    ensures that the permissions smart contract (which defines transfer rules)
    is called with each token transfer transaction between non-reserve accounts.
    Controller application id is part of the clawback logic sig (template parameter),
    to ensure there is a call to controller during a token-transfer.
    We separate the Controller smart contract from clawback to be able to update
    the permissions smart contract (or add a new one) without changing the clawback.
    It also handles kill_status of the token. If token is killed then no token transfers
    are allowed. User can only optOut of the asset.
