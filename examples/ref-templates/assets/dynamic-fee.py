    """
    The contract works by approving a group of two transactions (meaning the two transactions will occur together or not at all).

    - Suppose the owner of account A wants to send a payment to account TMPL_TO, but does not want
    to pay a transaction fee. If account A signs the following contract with the appropriate parameters
    (specifying all of the necessary details of the payment transaction), then anyone can cover a fee
    for that payment on account A's behalf.

    - The first transaction must spend the transaction fee into account A, and the second transaction
    must be the specified payment transaction from account A to account TMPL_TO.

    Parameters:
    TMPL_TO: the recipient of the payment from account A
    TMPL_AMT: the amount to send from account A to TMPL_TO in microAlgos
    TMPL_CLS: the account to close out the remainder of account A's funds to after paying TMPL_AMT to TMPL_TO
    TMPL_FV: the required first valid round of the payment from account A
    TMPL_LV: the required last valid round of the payment from account A
    TMPL_LEASE: the string to use for the transaction lease in the payment from account A (to avoid replay attacks)
