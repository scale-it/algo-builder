    """This contract implements a "hash time lock".
    The contract will approve transactions spending algos from itself under two circumstances:

    - If an argument arg_0 is passed to the script such that TMPL_HASHFN(arg_0) is equal to TMPL_HASHIMG,
    then funds may be closed out to TMPL_RCV.
    - If txn.FirstValid is greater than TMPL_TIMEOUT, then funds may be closed out to TMPL_OWN.

    The idea is that by knowing the preimage to TMPL_HASHIMG, funds may be released to
    TMPL_RCV (Scenario 1). Alternatively, after some timeout round TMPL_TIMEOUT,
    funds may be closed back to their original owner, TMPL_OWN (Scenario 2).
    Note that Scenario 1 may occur up until Scenario 2 occurs, even if TMPL_TIMEOUT has already passed.

    Parameters:
    TMPL_RCV: the address to send funds to when the preimage is supplied
    TMPL_HASHFN: the specific hash function (sha256 or keccak256) to use (sha256 in this example)
    TMPL_HASHIMG: the image of the hash function for which knowing the preimage under TMPL_HASHFN will release funds
    TMPL_TIMEOUT: the round after which funds may be closed out to TMPL_OWN
    TMPL_OWN: the address to refund funds to on timeout
    TMPL_FEE: maximum fee of any transactions approved by this contract """
