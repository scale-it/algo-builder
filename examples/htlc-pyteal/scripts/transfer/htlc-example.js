/**
 * Description:
 * This file demonstrates the PyTeal Example for HTLC(Hash Time Lock Contract)
 * In this scheme, the buyer funds a TEAL account with the sale price. 
 * The buyer also picks a secret value and encodes a secure hash of this value in 
 * the TEAL program. The TEAL program will transfer its balance to the seller 
 * if the seller is able to provide the secret value that corresponds to the hash in the program.
