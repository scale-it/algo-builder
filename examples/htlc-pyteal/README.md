# Hash-Time-Lock-Contract Example using PyTeal

In this example, Bob creates an escrow account protected by a hash time lock contract:
+ Alice can withdraw funds from the account only if she will get a secret
+ to avoid locking up the funds forever, Bob can get back the funds after a specified deadline.
A secret can represent a puzzle solution, or a coupon unveiled when Bob makes an action (eg receives assets or real world goods).

Files:

* `htlc.py` : It is the HTLC. SHA256 function is used for hashing. <br />
        secret value : `hero wisdom green split loop element vote belt` hashed with sha256 will produce `QzYhq9JlYbn2QdOMrhyxVlNtNjeyvyJc/I8d8VAGfGc=`  which is used in this code.
* `deploy.js` : It is used to create and fund HTLC contract account which is defined in `assets/htlc.py`.
* `htlc-withdraw.js` : It is used to show transactions between contract and a user.
