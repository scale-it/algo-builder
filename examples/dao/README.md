# Algo Builder DAO

A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is an entity with no central leadership. Decisions get made from the bottom-up, governed by a community organized around a specific set of rules enforced on a blockchain. DAOs are internet-native organizations collectively owned and managed by their members. They have built-in treasuries that are only accessible with the approval of their members. Decisions are made via proposals the group votes on during a specified period.

The project has been **moved** to it's own repository: [Sigma DAO](https://github.com/scale-it/sigmadao)\*\*.

It currently contain:

- full algo-builder project, with scripts and tests
- Vue.js frontend
- Customized Algorand indexer + graphql server.
