All our test files should be stored in `test` directory. You can import `algob` library as well as `scripts`.
Tests are typically done using [Mocha](https://mochajs.org/) framework, while assertions using [Chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) a BDD / TDD assertion library. Your test file is usually organized as follows:

```
describe("use-case", function() {
  let variable1;
  // ...

  this.beforeAll(() => { ... });
  this.afterAll(() => { ... });

  it("test case 1", () => {
    // preparation
    // execution
    // checks
  });

  it("test case 2", () => { ... });
});
```

# Test structure

In this section we will describe the flow of testing smart contracts in runtime:

- **Prepare Accounts**. First of all we need to create accounts which we will use in transactions:

```javascript
const john = new AccountStore(initialMicroAlgo);
const bob = new AccountStore(initialMicroAlgo, "bob");
```

`initialAlgo` is the amount of ALGO set for the created account. It's recommended to have at least 1 ALGO (1000000 micro ALGO) to cover transaction fees and to maintain minimum account balance.

- **Prepare Runtime**. Next we create a runtime with those accounts.

```
const runtime = new Runtime([john, bob]);
```

- **Set block round and timestamp**.

```javascript
runtime.setRoundAndTimestamp(20, 100);
```

- **Create Apps/Assets**. At this point our runtime is ready. Now we can create apps and assets, and begin testing our smart contracts (present in your current directory's `asset` folder). To create a stateful application (smart contract), use `runtime.addApp()` funtcion. Similarly to create a new asset use `runtime.addAsset()` function.
- **Create and Execute Transactions**. We can create transactions to test our smart contracts. You create a tranaction (Payment Transaction, Atomic Transfers, Asset Transfer etc...) as you would do it in algob: either using the JS SDK, or one of the high level algob functions. To execute tranasction use `runtime.executeTx()` funtion.
- **Update/Refresh State**. After a transaction is executed the state of an account will be updated. In order to inspect a new state of accounts we need to re-query them from the runtime. In algob examples we use `syncAccounts()` closure (see [example](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/6743acd/examples/restricted-assets/test/asset-txfer-test.js#L80)) closure which will reassign accounts to their latest state.
- **Verify State**: Now, we can verify if the `global state` and `local state` as well as accounts are correctly updated. We use `runtime.getGlobalState()` and `runtime.getLocalState()` to check the state and directly inspect account objects (after the `syncAccounts` is made).

!!! info
In an effort to make runtime API compatible with the [`deployer`](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/docs/guide/deployer.md), `runtime.addApp` & `runtime.addAsset` are now deprecated. Please use `runtime.deployApp` & `runtime.deployASA` respectively.

# Stateless TEAL (Smart Signature)

## Escrow Account

Let's try to execute a transaction where a user (say `john`) can withdraw funds from an `escrow` account based on a smart signature logic. In the example below, we will use a TEAL code from our [escrow account test](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/packages/runtime/test/fixtures/escrow-account/assets/escrow.teal).
The logic signature accepts only ALGO payment transaction where amount is <= 100 AND receiver is `john` AND fee <= 10000.

- First let's prepare the runtime and state: initialize accounts, get a logic signature for escrow and set up runtime:

```javascript
const minBalance = BigInt(ALGORAND_ACCOUNT_MIN_BALANCE + 1000); // 1000 to cover fee
const initialEscrowHolding = minBalance + BigInt(1000e6);
const initialJohnHolding = minBalance + 500n;
const fee = 1000;

// admin is an account used to fund escrow
let admin = new AccountStore(1e12);
let john = new AccountStore(initialJohnHolding);
const escrow = runtime.loadLogic("escrow.teal", []);
const runtime = new Runtime([john]); // setup runtime
```

- We create a helper function to update local accounts based on the runtime state

```javascript
function syncAccounts() {
	john = runtime.getAccount(john.address);
	escrow = runtime.getAccount(escrow.address);
}
```

- Execute transaction (using `runtime.executeTx()`) with valid txnParams.

```typescript
// set up transaction paramenters
let paymentTxParams: AlgoTransferParam = {
	type: TransactionType.TransferAlgo,
	sign: SignType.LogicSignature,
	lsig: lsig,
	fromAccountAddr: escrow.address,
	toAccountAddr: john.address,
	amountMicroAlgos: 100n,
	payFlags: { totalFee: fee },
};

it("should fund escrow account", function () {
	runtime.executeTx({
		type: TransactionType.TransferAlgo, // payment
		sign: SignType.SecretKey,
		fromAccount: admin.account,
		toAccountAddr: escrow.address,
		amountMicroAlgos: initialEscrowHolding,
		payFlags: { totalFee: fee },
	});

	// check initial balance
	syncAccounts();
	assert.equal(escrow.balance(), initialEscrowHolding);
	assert.equal(john.balance(), initialJohnHolding);
});

it("should withdraw funds from escrow if txn params are correct", function () {
	runtime.executeTx(paymentTxParams);

	// check final state (updated accounts)
	syncAccounts();
	assert.equal(escrow.balance(), initialEscrowHolding - 100n - BigInt(fee));
	assert.equal(john.balance(), initialJohnHolding + 100n);
});
```

In the first test above, we fund the escrow using the admin account. John already has an initial balance set - we initialized runtime with John's account. In the second test we execute payment transaction from escrow to john and validate that the balances are correct.

- Executing transaction with invalid transaction.

```javascript
it("should reject transaction if amount > 100", function () {
	expectRuntimeError(
		() => runtime.executeTx({ ...paymentTxParams, amountMicroAlgos: 500n }),
		RUNTIME_ERRORS.TEAL.REJECTED_BY_LOGIC
	);
});
```

Full example with above tests is available in our [escrow-account.ts](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/packages/runtime/test/integration/escrow-account.ts) integration test suite.

## Delegated Signature Account

Let's try to execute a transaction where a user (`john`) will use delegated signature based on a smart signature logic. We will use a TEAL code from our [asset test](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/packages/runtime/test/fixtures/basic-teal/assets/basic.teal) suite.

- As before we start with preparing the runtime. We use `runtime.loadLogic('escrow.teal', [])` to create and load logic signature.

```javascript
let john = new AccountStore(initialJohnHolding);
let bob = new AccountStore(initialBobHolding);
let runtime = new Runtime([john, bob]);
```

- We will create a test with valid delegated signature check and try to use it to send ALGO from the delegator account.

```typescript
const txnParams: ExecParams = {
	type: TransactionType.TransferAlgo, // payment
	sign: SignType.LogicSignature,
	fromAccountAddr: john.account.addr,
	toAccountAddr: bob.address,
	amountMicroAlgos: 100n,
	lsig: {} as LogicSig, // will be set below
	payFlags: { totalFee: fee },
};

it("should send algo's from john to bob if delegated logic check passes", function () {
	// check initial balance
	assert.equal(john.balance(), initialJohnHolding);
	assert.equal(bob.balance(), initialBobHolding);

	// get delegated logic signature
	const lsig = runtime.loadLogic("basic.teal", []);
	lsig.sign(john.account.sk);
	txnParams.lsig = lsig;

	runtime.executeTx(txnParams);

	syncAccounts();
	assert.equal(john.balance(), initialJohnHolding - 100n - BigInt(fee));
	assert.equal(bob.balance(), initialBobHolding + 100n);
});
```

- In the next test, create a delegated signature which verification will fail. We check that the transfer was not done and the balances didn't change.

```javascript
it("should fail if delegated logic check doesn't pass", function () {
	const johnBal = john.balance();
	const bobBal = bob.balance();
	const lsig = runtime.loadLogic("incorrect-logic.teal", []);
	lsig.sign(john.account.sk);
	txnParams.lsig = lsig;

	// should fail because logic check fails
	expectRuntimeError(
		() => runtime.executeTx({ ...txnParams, amountMicroAlgos: 50n }),
		RUNTIME_ERRORS.TEAL.REJECTED_BY_LOGIC
	);

	// accounts balance shouldn't be changed
	syncAccounts();
	assert.equal(john.balance(), johnBal);
	assert.equal(bob.balance(), bobBal);
});
```

Full example with the above tests is available in our [basic-teal](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/packages/runtime/test/integration/basic-teal.ts) integration test suite.

# Stateful TEAL

Now, we will execute a transaction with an app call (stateful TEAL). The app is a simple smart contract which increments a global and local "counter" during each application call. Teal code can be found [here](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/packages/runtime/test/fixtures/stateful/assets/counter-approval.teal)

- Similar to the previous test, we need to setup accounts and initialize runtime. Now, for stateful smart contract, we also need to create a new application in user account and opt-in (to call the stateful smart contract later). User can use `runtime.deployApp()` and `runtime.optInToApp()` for app setup.

```javascript
const john = new AccountStore(1000);
let runtime: Runtime;
let program: string;

const txnParams: ExecParams = {
	type: TransactionType.CallApp,
	sign: SignType.SecretKey,
	fromAccount: john.account,
	appId: 0,
	payFlags: { totalFee: fee },
};

this.beforeAll(async function () {
	runtime = new Runtime([john]); // setup test

	// create new app
	txnParams.appId = await runtime.deployApp(
		john.account, // creator of application
		{
			appName: "CounterApp",
			metaType: MetaType.File
			approvalProgramFilename: "counter-approval.teal",
			approvalProgramFilename: "clear-program",
			globalBytes: 32,
			globalInts: 32,
			localBytes: 8,
			localInts: 8,
		},
		{}
	).appID;

	// opt-in to the app
	await runtime.optInToApp(txnParams.appId, john.address, {}, {});
});
```

- After set up, let's call the stateful smart contract and check the updated global state

```javascript
const key = "counter";
it("should set global and local counter to 1 on first call", function () {
	runtime.executeTx(txnParams);

	const globalCounter = runtime.getGlobalState(txnParams.appId, key);
	assert.equal(globalCounter, 1n);

	const localCounter = runtime.getAccount(john.address).getLocalState(txnParams.appId, key); // get local value from john account
	assert.equal(localCounter, 1n);
});
```

In this test, after executing a transaction with stateful smart contract call, we are verifying if the `global state` and `local state` are updated correctly. User can use `runtime.getGlobalState()` and `runtime.getLocalState()` to check state.

Please look at [stateful-counter.ts](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/packages/runtime/test/integration/stateful-counter.ts) to see the complete integration test suite.

# Best Practices

- Follow the Test Structure section to setup your tests.
- Structure tests using AAA pattern: Arrange, Act & Assert (AAA). The first part includes the test setup, then the execution of the unit under test, and finally the assertion phase. Following this structure guarantees that the reader will quickly understand the test plan.
- To prevent test coupling and easily reason about the test flow, each test should add and act on its own set of states.
- Use `beforeEach`, `afterEach`, `beforeAll`, `afterAll` functions to setup and clean shared resources in your tests.
- Sync your accounts' before checking their state.
