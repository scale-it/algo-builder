The purpose of the tutorial is to demonstrate how to connect to Algorand wallet in browser and interact with blockchain via wallets. To accomplish this objective, we will use the Vue front-end library to connect to a different wallets like MyAlgo wallet, Wallet Connect and AlgoSigner using different networks and perform a transaction.

### Requirements

- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)<br/>
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) 14.11.0 or above<br/>
- JavaScript package manager - either [YARN](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) version 3.1.0 or above or NPM which comes with NodeJS.<br/>
- IDE, e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)<br/>
- Other dependencies are listed in [package.json](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder-templates/blob/master/wallet/package.json). Install them with yarn install or npm install.<br/>

### Background
This is a Web Application created using Vue through which one can connect to Algorand Blockchain and perform transaction (for eg: send Algo or call application) by connecting to your algorand wallet, select different accounts available on different networks such as MainNet, TestNet, BetaNet.

### Steps

 #### 1. Development
   The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub. Start by cloning the repository:<br/>
   `git clone https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder-templates.git`

   Change into the project directory:<br/>
   `cd algo-builder-templates`

   The repository contains the following templates:<br/>
   **htlc** : This is a descriptive example explaining how HTLC contracts work with Algo-Builder.<br/>
   **monitor-payments**: This is a nodejs app which monitors payment transactions to a particular address.<br/>
   **shop**: This demonstrates the usage of a payment widget to trigger a purchase by connecting to different wallets.<br/>
   **wallet**: This helps in connecting to different wallets.<br/>
   **warcraft**: This is a descriptive example explaining how Escrow contract work with Algo-Builder.<br/>

   Migrate to wallet directory:<br/>
   `cd wallet`

 #### 2. Environment Setup
   Install all dependencies in your environment:<br/>
   ` yarn install` or `npm install`

   Now, run the app for local development. It will automatically update when there are any changes.<br/>
   `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`

   After successfully running, your browser screen will look similar to this.
   <img src="./t-05/assets/homescreen.png" height="200" title="Home Page" />

   Now you can select your preferred network and connect to the wallet as per your choice.
   <img src="./t-05/assets/address_selected.png" height="200" title="Account Selected" />

   You can now interact with the algorand blockchain, by sending algos, or call an application.
   <img src="./t-05/assets/algo_transaction.png" height="200" title="Send Transaction" />

   You can also update the address to which algos are sent, the algo amount or the application ID by configuring it in `src/constants`.

   ```ts
   export const toAddress = "WK73JQQGCRQCZ5GLQHCXXB6OXIGF6SD22F5P7HPXF5PNH23YUUALUMKOZ4";
   export const amount: number = 10e6;
   export const applicationId: number = 189;
   ```

   And finally you can disconnect your chosen wallet.
