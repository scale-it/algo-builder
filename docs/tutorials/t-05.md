The purpose of the tutorial a demonstration of Algorand Wallet Widget integrated with the [Algo Builder Web](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/tree/master/packages/web) package, Written in  Vue JS. The widget connects to major Algorand wallets (Algo Signer, Wallet Connect, MyAlgoWallet), sign and send transactions constructed with Algo SDK or Algo Builder framework.

### Requirements

- [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/installation.html)<br/>
- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) > v14.11.0<br/>
- JavaScript package manager - either [YARN](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) version 3.1.0 or above or NPM which comes with NodeJS.<br/>
- IDE, e.g. [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)<br/>
- Other dependencies are listed in [package.json](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder-templates/blob/master/wallet/package.json). Install them with yarn install or npm install.<br/>

### Background
Algorand ecosystem lacks a maintained Vue JS component connected to main Algorand web wallets.

[Algo Builder](https://algobuilder.dev/) is one of the main major frameworks for smart contract development and integrations. We took a responsibility to provide for a community a Vue JS wallet widget, well integrated with the Algo Builder framework and Algo SDK. 

In this tutorial we create a basic Vue jS web application which connects web wallets and perform simple transaction (for eg: send Algo or call application). With the wallet widget a user can:
* select a network (such as MainNet, TestNet, BetaNet),
* switch an account,
* interact with the web wallet.

### Steps

 #### 1. Development
   The source code for this tutorial can be found on GitHub. Start by cloning the repository:<br/>
   `git clone https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder-templates.git`

   Change into the project directory:<br/>
   `cd algo-builder-templates`

   The repository contains the following templates:<br/>
   **htlc** : This is a descriptive example explaining how HTLC contracts work with Algo-Builder.<br/>
   **monitor-payments**: This is a nodejs app which monitors payment transactions to a particular address.<br/>
   **shop**: This demonstrates the usage of a payment widget to trigger a purchase by connecting to different wallets.<br/>
   **wallet**: This helps in connecting to different wallets.<br/>
   **warcraft**: This is a descriptive example explaining how Escrow contract work with Algo-Builder.<br/>

   Migrate to wallet directory:<br/>
   `cd wallet`

 #### 2. Environment Setup
   Install all dependencies in your environment:<br/>
   ` yarn install` or `npm install`

   Now, run the app for local development. It will automatically update when there are any changes.<br/>
   `yarn run dev` or `npm run dev`

   After successfully running, your browser screen will look similar to this.
   <img src="./t-05/assets/homescreen.png" height="200" title="Home Page" />

   Now you can select your preferred network and connect to the wallet as per your choice.
   <img src="./t-05/assets/address_selected.png" height="200" title="Account Selected" />

   You can now interact with the algorand blockchain, by sending algos, or call an application.
   <img src="./t-05/assets/algo_transaction.png" height="200" title="Send Transaction" />

   You can also update the address to which algos are sent, the algo amount or the application ID by configuring it in `src/constants`.

   ```ts
   export const toAddress = "WK73JQQGCRQCZ5GLQHCXXB6OXIGF6SD22F5P7HPXF5PNH23YUUALUMKOZ4";
   export const amount: number = 10e6;
   export const applicationId: number = 189;
   ```

   And finally you can disconnect your chosen wallet.
