# Step 1: Algorand Node Setup
**TL;DR**: **Make sure you have Algorand Node (`algod` and `goal`) and `make` installed**. Then `cd infrastructure; make setup-private-net`. To reset use `recreate-private-net`.

This step is optional. We recommend doing it, to reproduce the same test account setup. 

We start with setting up an Algorand Node. You can use Sandbox, but here we will show you how you can use our infrastructure scripts. Firstly make sure you have an algorand node [installed](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/run-a-node/setup/install/) and available in your PATH:

```shell
% algod -v
8590131200
2.3.0.stable [rel/stable] (commit #07bc97b7)
```

If the node is installed, but the `algod` command is not accessible, then search how to add a binary / executable to your OS PATH.

Next we clone our repository. If you installed `algob` from source, then you can skip this step and just go to the repository root.

```
git clone https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder.git
```

Go to `infrastructure` directory and call `make`:

```
cd infrastructure
make create-private-net start-private-net
make setup-master-account
```

The first command will setup the private algorand network with one node and run it. The second command will create a _master_ account and fund it with lot of Algos. The _master_ account is the main account we will use in all our tutorials. If you are using different configuration (eg Sandbox) then in all steps below you will need to use different master account. Let's verify if everything works:

```shell
% make status-private-net
goal network status -r ./node_data

[PrimaryNode]
Last committed block: 69
Time since last block: 1.6s
Sync Time: 0.0s
...

% goal account list -d ./node_data/PrimaryNode
[online]	IXX4X3NNZXMAN3YCX64XR2KFORFDDDKJIVUKSEVT5L37IJAL2PIZXJFJLM	IXX4X3NNZXMAN3YCX64XR2KFORFDDDKJIVUKSEVT5L37IJAL2PIZXJFJLM	9998019995998998 microAlgos
[offline]	Unnamed-0	WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE	2000004000000 microAlgos	*Default
```

`WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE` is our _master_ account. If you use different account, then don't forget to update the file in the next step by setting right account parameters. You can do it by setting mneumonic, private key or even connect to KMD. You can find details in the config documentation linked in the step below.

We also have a quick setup using Sandbox section in our infrastructure scripts (no algorand node is required). Read more about it [here](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/tree/master/infrastructure#quick-start-using-sandbox). 

# Step 2: create an algob project

If you installed `algob` correctly, you should be able to run `algob --version`. If not, then go back and inspect your [installation](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/#installation).




Let's create a new project:
```shell
% algob init algob-part1-asa
% cd algob-part1-asa
```

Now we need to add `@algo-builder/algob` as a dependency (you can use `npm` instead of `yarn`).

```shell
# If you installed from npm:
yarn add @algo-builder/algob

# otherwise, if you installed from souce and linked algob
yarn link @algo-builder/algob
```

Now our project has an access to `@algo-builder` libraries. The generated project is pre-configured to use the credentials of the private network created in step1. If you use different network, then open the `algob.config.js` file and update network object:

```javascript
let defaultCfg = {
  host: "http://localhost",
  port: 8080,
  token: "aade468d25a7aa48fec8082d6a847c48492066a2741f3731e613fdde086cd6e9",
  accounts: accounts,
};
```

The `accounts` attribute should contain a `master` account, which will be used later in the tutorial to activate other accounts and pay transaction fees.

!!! tip
    If you don't use the same node setup as described in Step 1, you **must** update the `master` account to an account with ALGO you control. You can do it by setting private key, memo or connecting to KMD. Please read our [config documentation](http://algobuilder.dev/guide/algob-config.html) for more details about algob configuration, options to set accounts and configure networks.

Let's verify that it's wired up correctly:

```shell
% algob node-info
NETWORK NAME default
NODE ADDRESS {
  host: 'http://localhost',
  port: 8080,
  token: 'aade468d25a7aa48fec8082d6a847c48492066a2741f3731e613fdde086cd6e9',
  accounts: [
    {
      name: 'master',
      addr: 'WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE',
      sk: [Uint8Array]
    }
  ]
}
NODE STATUS {
  ...
}
```

# Step 3: inspect project structure

The generated project has the following structure:

```
├── algob.config.js
├── assets
│   ├── accounts_user.yaml
│   ├── asa.yaml
│   └── fee-check.teal
├── node_modules
│   └── ...
├── package.json
├── README.md
├── scripts
│   ├── 0-sampleScript.js
│   └── 1-sampleScript.js
└── tests
```

`algob.config.js` is a place where we store node access information (network), accounts and other settings. The `assets` directory is used to store smart contracts, accounts (optionally) and smart contract code. `scripts` is where we put all code related to transactions and deployment.

# Step 4: Create Gold ASA

Open the `assets/asa.yaml` file. It contains definition of sample ASA: `minimumASA` and `allFieldASA`. Each ASA is a map of all possible ASA [parameters](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asa/). The `allFieldASA` is an example with list of all possible parameters.

Let's define our own ASA. Delete the content of the file and fill it with the following content:

```yaml
gold:
  total: 5912599999515
  decimals: 0
  defaultFrozen: false
  unitName: "GLD"
  url: "url"
  # User may get "signature validation failed" from node if shorter hash is used.
  metadataHash: "12312442142141241244444411111133"
  note: "note"
  noteb64: "noteb64"
  manager: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  reserve: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  freeze: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  clawback: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  optInAccNames: ["john"]
tesla:
  total: 300000
  decimals: 0
  defaultFrozen: false
  unitName: "TSLA"
  url: "url"
  # User may get "signature validation failed" from node if shorter hash is used.
  metadataHash: "12312442142141241244444411111133"
  note: "note"
  noteb64: "noteb64"
  manager: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  reserve: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  freeze: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
  clawback: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE"
```

This contains definition of two assets: gold and tesla. It's worth to note the `optInAccNames` attribute - it contains a list of account names (as defined in the algob.config.js) which will be automatically opted-in when the ASA will be deployed.


# Step 4: add accounts to the config

Open the `algob.config.js` file. Find the `accounts` variable definition and update it to:

```javascript
let accounts = mkAccounts([
  {
    // This account is created using `make setup-master-account` command from our
    // `/infrastructure` directory.
    // If you want to use different account then change it to other address you control.
    // To export a mnemonic you may use the following command:
    // goal account export -a "your_account_address" -d $ALGORAND_DATA
    name: "master-account",
    addr: "WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE",
    mnemonic: "enforce drive foster uniform cradle tired win arrow wasp melt cattle chronic sport dinosaur announce shell correct shed amused dismiss mother jazz task above hospital"
  },
  // These are generated account, we will fund them later in this tutorial using algob
  {
    name: "elon-musk",
    addr: "WHVQXVVCQAD7WX3HHFKNVUL3MOANX3BYXXMEEJEJWOZNRXJNTN7LTNPSTY",
    mnemonic: "resist derive table space jealous person pink ankle hint venture manual spawn move harbor flip cigar copy throw swap night series hybrid chest absent art"
  }, {
    name: "john",
    addr: "2UBZKFR6RCZL7R24ZG327VKPTPJUPFM6WTG7PJG2ZJLU234F5RGXFLTAKA",
    mnemonic: "found empower message suit siege arrive dad reform museum cake evoke broom comfort fluid flower wheat gasp baby auction tuna sick case camera about flip"
  }
]);

```

If you run again `algob node-info` you should see the new accounts in the output.


# Step 5: create a deployment script

All scripts are stored in the `scripts` directory. Remove files from `scripts`, and create a new one: `scripts/0-gold.js` with the following content:

```javascript
const { executeTransaction, balanceOf } = require('@algo-builder/algob');
const { types } = require('@algo-builder/web');

// a helper function used to create fund transaction
function mkParam(senderAccount, receiverAddr, amount, payFlags) {
  return {
    type: types.TransactionType.TransferAlgo,
    sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
    fromAccount: senderAccount,
    toAccountAddr: receiverAddr,
    amountMicroAlgos: amount,
    payFlags: payFlags
  };
};


// This is an entry function in our script (a default, exported function)
async function run (runtimeEnv, deployer) {
  console.log('[gold]: Script has started execution!');

  // we start with extracting acocunt objects from the config.
  const masterAccount = deployer.accountsByName.get('master-account');
  const goldOwner = deployer.accountsByName.get('alice');
  const john = deployer.accountsByName.get('john');
  const bob = deployer.accountsByName.get('bob');

  // Accounts can only be active if they poses minimum amont of ALGOs.
  // Here we fund the accounts with 5e6, 5e6 and 1e6 AlGOs.
  const message = 'funding account';
  const promises = [
    executeTransaction(deployer, mkParam(masterAccount, goldOwner.addr, 5e6, { note: message })),
    executeTransaction(deployer, mkParam(masterAccount, john.addr, 5e6, { note: message })),
    executeTransaction(deployer, mkParam(masterAccount, bob.addr, 1e6, { note: message }))];
  await Promise.all(promises);


  // Let's deploy ASA. The following commnad will open the `assets/asa.yaml` file and search for
  // the `gold` ASA. The transaction can specify standard transaction parameters. If skipped
  // node suggested values will be used.
  const asaInfo = await deployer.deployASA('gold', {
    creator: goldOwner
    // totalFee: 1001,
    // feePerByte: 100,
    // firstValid: 10,
    // validRounds: 1002
  });
  console.log(asaInfo);

  // In asa.yaml we only added `john` to opt-in accounts. Let's add `bob` as well using the
  // script;
  await deployer.optInToASA('gold', 'bob', {});

  // to interact with an asset we need asset ID. We can get it from the returned object:
  const assetID = asaInfo.assetIndex;

  // we can inspect the balance of the goldOnwer. It should equal to the `total` value defined
  // in the asa.yaml.
  await balanceOf(deployer, goldOwner.addr, assetID);

  console.log('[gold]: Script execution has finished!');
}

module.exports = { default: run };
```

The script above defines `run` function - it is set as a default, exported function from that module. `algob` will run the default function and pass [runtime information](http://algobuilder.dev/api/algob/interfaces/types.runtimeenv.html) and [deployer](http://algobuilder.dev/api/algob/interfaces/types.deployer.html) into it's argument. The deployer is an object which provides `Algodv2` client (algosdk-js algorand driver instance), and lot of useful functions to deploy and manage assets as well as running transactions. You can read about algob deployer [here](http://algobuilder.dev/guide/deployer.html). You can inspect all types provided by `algob` at our [API types documentation](http://algobuilder.dev/api/algob/modules/types.html)

Firstly we query accounts defined in our config file. Then we transfer some ALGOs to fund and activate that accounts. Finally we deploy _gold_ and opt-in john to gold.

We can run the script with:

    algob deploy scripts/0-gold.js

In the output you will see transactions and additional information requested in the script. This command will create `artifacts` directory. There are 2 important files created:

* artifacts/scripts/0-gold.js.<timestamp>.log - contains a transaction log of all transaction run by `deployer`. This file is useful in the future to inspect transactions.
* artifacts/scripts/0-gold.js.cp.yaml - a deployer checkpoint. It contains a list of assets and smart contract deployed. Moreover, this file is used to protect a deployment script to be run twice in the same network. Let's check! If we run `algob deploy scripts/0-gold.js` for the second time we will see:

    ```
    Skipping: Checkpoint exists for script scripts/0-gold.js

    ```

Read more about checkpoint concept [here](http://algobuilder.dev/guide/execution-checkpoints.html).


# Step 6: create a script to transfer ASA

Create a subdirectory in scripts:

```
mkdir scripts/transfer
```

And create a `scripts/transfer/gold-to-john.js` file with the following content:

```javascript
const { executeTransaction, balanceOf } = require('@algo-builder/algob');
const { types } = require('@algo-builder/web');

async function run (runtimeEnv, deployer) {
  // query gold ASA from deployer (using checkpoint information),
  const goldAsset = deployer.asa.get('gold')
  if (goldAsset) {
    console.error("Gold was not deployed. You must run `algob deploy` first.")
    return
  }

  const goldAssetID = goldAsset.assetIndex;

  // query accounts from config
  const john = deployer.accountsByName.get('john');
  const goldOwner = deployer.accountsByName.get('alice');

  // execute asset transfer transaction
  await executeTransaction(deployer, {
    type: types.TransactionType.TransferAsset,
    sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
    fromAccount: goldOwner,
    toAccountAddr: john.addr,
    amount: 1,
    assetID: goldAssetID,
    payFlags: {}
  });

  console.log("Balance: ", await balanceOf(deployer, john.addr, goldAssetID));
}

module.exports = { default: run };
```

Similarly to `scripts/0-gold.js`, this file exports one default function. This function, however, will not be run using `algob deploy`. Instead, we will use `algob run`:

    algob run scripts/transfer/gold-to-john.js

The main difference between `run` and `deploy` is that:
* `run` doesn't create checkpoints
* `run` provides a limited version of `deployer`. It's stripped from deployment functionality, and can only run standard transactions and query deployed objects.
* `run` is used for auxiliary transaction (which can be run multiple times), `deploy` is used for deployment (things which should be run only once per network).

You can read more about two deployer modes (`run` and `deploy`) at [Deployer Specification](https://paper.dropbox.com/doc/Algorand-builder-specs--BDiIrwHlXQf~95hkR85Y1qbFAg-Vcdp0XNngizChyUWvFXfs#:uid=890652850917836099875362&h2=Deployment-and-Execution).

# Summary

In this tutorial we created and deployed gold ASA, we show how we can access and manage basic accounts and used the deployer object in a separate script to load deployed ASA object and create an asset transfer transaction.

Full source code is available in the [scale-it/algo-builder-tutorial](https://github.com/scale-it/algorand-builder-tutorial/tree/part-1) repository (branch: `part-1`).

Algob supports much more: you can load accounts from KMD or ENV variables, you can run a REPL, generate accounts, compile smart contracts and execute tests. In next episodes we will discover more `algob` features.

We would like to encourage you to read our [documentation](http://algobuilder.dev/guide/README) and share a feedback using GitHub [issues](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/issues).
