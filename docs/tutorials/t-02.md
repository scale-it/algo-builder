# 1. Introduction to algob `Deployer`

By now it must be clear how our package `algob` provides so many wonderful interfaces which make the need of writing lengthy complex code perish. One of these interfaces is `Deployer`.

`Deployer` makes the task of deploying (creation) and running (execution) transactions easier. Deployer as a single entity provides the functionality of handling several accounts, performing different types of transactions, storing mapping of several checkpoints in the network and the full functionality of Smart Contracts ([Stateful](<(https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asc1/stateful/)>) or [Logic/Smart Signature Account](<(https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asc1/modes/)>)).

Deployer is also efficient in handling PyTEAL files. During the process of funding a contract account, deploying Stateful Smart Contracts (SSC) or making delegated logic signatures, a deployer will browse smart contract code and use it when interacting with the blockchain and smart contracts.

You can learn more about `Deployer` in more detail in our [documentation](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/docs/guide/deployer.md).

In this tutorial we will focus on **smart signatures** (also called stateless smart contract or logic signatures).

# 2. Creating TEAL files

In the `algob` project structure, the TEAL and PyTEAL code files are always placed in the `/assets/**` directory:

```
algob project:
├── assets
│   ├── TEAL files
│ 	├── PyTEAL files
├── scripts
│	├── deploy.ts
│ 	├── run.ts
├── package.json
```

Check [a simple tutorial on writing simple smart contracts](https://developer.algorand.org/tutorials/writing-simple-smart-contract/) to learn more about TEAL.

## Simple Example

We will create a simple smart signature contract which will check if a fee is smaller than 10k micro Algo. Put the code below in `/assets/feecheck.teal`:

```teal
txn Fee
int 10000
<=
```

To deploy the contract use the following code in one of your scripts (in `./scripts`):

```
let lsig = await deployer.loadLogicByFile('feecheck.teal', []);
```

The first argument is the smart contract file with the source code. Algob will search for it in `./assets/**/` directory. The second argument is list of arguments used when making a logic signature transaction. In this example we don't provide any transaction so the list is empty.

!!! Note
Each argument must be either a number or byte array.

Now you can use `lsig` whenever a `LogicSig` object is expected. Example:

```
// opt in lsig to ASA
await deployer.optInLsigToASA('asa-name-or-id', lsig, { totalFee: 1000 });

// execute transaction:
const { executeTx } = require('@algo-builder/algob');
const { types } = require('@algo-builder/web');
await deployer.executeTx([{
  type: types.TransactionType.TransferAsset,
  sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
  fromAccount: ownerAccount,
  toAccountAddr: lsig.address(),
  amount: 1e5,
  assetID: goldAssetID,
  payFlags: { totalFee: 1000 }
}]);
```

Then while running `$ algob deploy ./scripts/yourscript.js`, the `algob` will automatically compile and cache the TEAL program for you. The compilation will be run only when the TEAL code has been modified. You can find the compiled code in `./artifacts/cache`.

You can also compile all TEAL code with:

```
$ algob compile
```

# 3. Creating PyTEAL

[PyTEAL](https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) acts as an interface between high level programming and assembly level code. Developers can use PyTEAL to design the logic behind smart contracts purely in Python.

`algob` supports PyTEAL as well. All you need is Python3 and [pipenv](https://pipenv.pypa.io/en/latest/). The latter is a tool that aims to bring the best of all packaging worlds and dependency management. To use pipenv:

- Clone and enter to our repository
  `$ cd ~/ && git clone https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder && cd algo-builder`
- Create a virtualenv and setup all dependencies
  `$ pipenv sync`
- Activate the virtual environment
  `$ pipenv shell`

Alternatively you can create your own setup (using virtualenv or global installation of [PyTEAL](https://pyteal.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html)). The only thing we require is Python3 with PyTEAL.

Now you can put your PyTEAL code in `assets` directory and use it as it any other TEAL code. The `algob` will automatically detect that it is a PyTEAL code and it will first compile it to TEAL and then compile the TEAL code.

# 4. Full Example

We will implement the Hash Time Lock contract in PyTEAL based on the [developer.algorand.org templates](https://developer.algorand.org/docs/reference/teal/templates/htlc). Read the linked document - it's necessary to understand the next section.

## Smart Contract Code

First, let's declare template variables:

```python
john = Addr("2UBZKFR6RCZL7R24ZG327VKPTPJUPFM6WTG7PJG2ZJLU234F5RGXFLTAKA")
master = Addr("WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE")
fee = 10000
hash_image = "QzYhq9JlYbn2QdOMrhyxVlNtNjeyvyJc/I8d8VAGfGc="
timeout = 2000
```

`master` is our default account we use in algob private net. The **secret**, which will protect the escrow funds is `"hero wisdom green split loop element vote belt"`. It will be provided as an argument to the smart signature, which will check if it's hash equal to the stored one (`hash_image`).

Here is the PyTEAL code. The `ARG_*` are the placeholder parameters, which can are provided as a Python function arguments:

```python
from pyteal import *

john = Addr("2UBZKFR6RCZL7R24ZG327VKPTPJUPFM6WTG7PJG2ZJLU234F5RGXFLTAKA")
master = Addr("WWYNX3TKQYVEREVSW6QQP3SXSFOCE3SKUSEIVJ7YAGUPEACNI5UGI4DZCE")
fee = 10000
hash_image = "QzYhq9JlYbn2QdOMrhyxVlNtNjeyvyJc/I8d8VAGfGc="
timeout = 2000

def htlc(ARG_RCV,
        ARG_OWN,
        ARG_FEE,
        ARG_HASHIMG,
        ARG_HASHFN,
        ARG_TIMEOUT):

    # First, check that the fee of this transaction is less than or equal to ARG_FEE
    fee_check = Txn.fee() < Int(ARG_FEE)

    # Next, check that this is a payment transaction.
    pay_check = Txn.type_enum() == TxnType.Payment

    # Next, check that the Receiver field for this transaction is empty
    # Because this contract can approve transactions that close out its entire balance,
    # it should never have a receiver.
    rec_field_check = Txn.receiver() == Global.zero_address()

    # Next, check that the Amount of algos transferred is 0. This is for the same reason as
    # above: we only allow transactions that close out this account completely, which
    # having a non-zero-address CloseRemainderTo will handle for us.
    amount_check = Txn.amount() == Int(0)

    # Always verify that the RekeyTo property of any transaction is set to the ZeroAddress
    # unless the contract is specifically involved ina rekeying operation.
    rekey_check = Txn.rekey_to() == Global.zero_address()

    # fold all the above checks into a single boolean.
    common_checks = And(
        fee_check,
        pay_check,
        rec_field_check,
        amount_check,
        rekey_check
    )

    # Payout scenarios : At this point in the execution, there is one boolean variable on the
    # stack that must be true in order for the transaction to be valid. The checks we have done
    # above apply to any transaction that may be approved by this script.We will now check if we
    # are in one of the two payment scenarios described in the functionality section."""

    # Scenario 1: Hash preimage has been revealed
    # First, check that the CloseRemainderTo field is set to be the ARG_RCV address.
    recv_field_check = Txn.close_remainder_to() == ARG_RCV

    # Next, we will check that arg_0 is the correct preimage for ARG_HASHIMG under ARG_HASHFN.
    preimage_check = ARG_HASHFN(Arg(0)) == Bytes("base64", ARG_HASHIMG)

    #Fold the "Scenario 1" checks into a single boolean.
    scenario_1 = And(recv_field_check, preimage_check)


    # Scenario 2: Contract has timed out
    # First, check that the CloseRemainderTo field is set to be the ARG_OWN address
    # (presumably initialized to be the original owner of the funds).
    owner_field_check = Txn.close_remainder_to() == ARG_OWN

    # Next, check that this transaction has only occurred after the ARG_TIMEOUT round.
    timeout_check = Txn.first_valid() > Int(ARG_TIMEOUT)

    #Fold the "Scenario 2" checks into a single boolean.
    scenario_2 = And(owner_field_check, timeout_check)

    # At this point in the program's execution, the stack has three values. At the base of the
    # stack is a boolean holding the results of the initial transaction validity checks.
    # This is followed by two booleans indicating the results of the scenario 1 and 2 checks.

    # We want to approve this transaction if we are in scenario 1 or 2.
    # So we logically OR the results of those checks together.
    # Finally, we logically AND the scenario checks with the initial checks.
    # At this point, the stack contains just one value: a boolean indicating
    # whether or not it has been approved by this contract.
    return And(Or(scenario_1, scenario_2), common_checks)

# Implement optimizer for improving performance and reducing resource consumption
optimize_options = OptimizeOptions(scratch_slots=True)

# print the compiled TEAL to the stdout:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    print(compileTeal(htlc(john, master, fee, hash_image, Sha256, timeout), Mode.Signature, optimize=optimize_options))
```

We save this file in `assets/htlc.py`

## Run the Contract

Let's create the contract account and fund it with some ALGOs. The smart signatures program code is not _installed_ into the blockchain. Instead, the compiled code has to be provided on every call and used executed to validate certain conditions. That's why we also call them _Logic Signatures_ (short `lsig`)- it's a program (logic) providing a signature. Address of an account referenced by a lsig is a hash of it's compiled code.

Let's create our script.

!!! info
_Logic Signature_, _Stateless Smart Contracts_ are now referred as _Smart Signatures_.

### Create user accounts

```javascript
const masterAccount = deployer.accountsByName.get("master-account");
const john = deployer.accountsByName.get("john");

// let's make sure john account is active and it has enough balance
const txnParams = mkTxnParams(masterAccount, john.addr, 4e6, {}, { note: "funding account" });
txnParams.sign = types.SignType.SecretKey;
await deployer.executeTx([txnParams]);
```

In the code above we declare user accounts and fund `john` account. `masterAccount` is the default account used in algob private net.

### Interact with the contract

First we need to put some money into the contract. `master` account will fund it:

```javascript
// setup a contract account and send 1 ALGO from master
await deployer.fundLsigByFile(
	"htlc.py",
	{
		funder: masterAccount,
		fundingMicroAlgo: 1e6, // 1 Algo
	},
	{ closeRemainderTo: john.addr },
	[]
);
```

We can create a [checkpoint](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/docs/guide/execution-checkpoints.md) to store the transaction log:

```javascript
await deployer.addCheckpointKV("User Checkpoint", "Fund Contract Account");
```

Now, we will use `john` account to withdraw from the smart contract. First we will test it with a wrong secret. We will also reuse and update the transaction parameters created earlier (`txnParams`) to instrument `algob` to create an `lsig` transaction:

```javascript
let wrongSecret = "wrong";
let contract = await deployer.loadLogicByFile("htlc.py", [stringToBytes(wrongSecret)]);
let contractAddress = contract.address();

txnParams.fromAccount = { addr: contractAddress };
txnParams.sign = types.SignType.LogicSignature;
txnParams.toAccountAddr = globalZeroAddress;
txnParams.amountMicroAlgos = 0;
txnParams.lsig = contract;
txnParams.payFlags = { totalFee: 1000, closeRemainderTo: john.addr };
await deployer.executeTx([txnParams]);
```

The last statement will fail and we will see an appropriate log in the screen, as well as in the artifacts:

```
smart-contract source "htlc.py" didn't change, skipping.
Transaction Failed Error: cannot POST /v2/transactions (400)
    at Response.toError (/home/robert/projects/algorand/algo-builder/node_modules/superagent/src/node/response.js:95:15)

    at Request._emitResponse (/home/robert/projects/algorand/algo-builder/node_modules/superagent/src/node/index.js:928:20)

  status: 400,
...
transaction 7ZDSTDC6Q2CWEWTDNETF2RYBPMXEDRMTOPZIC5GISKQRJRJQWSGQ: rejected by logic"}
```

As we can see the transaction is not validated because the lsig verification didn't pass (we provided the wrong secret). The first line ("smart-contract source "htlc.py" didn't change, skipping.") says that we don't need to recompile the smart contract and `algob` will use it's cached version.

Now, let's provide the right secret:

```javascript
const secret = "hero wisdom green split loop element vote belt";
contract = await deployer.loadLogicByFile("htlc.py", [stringToBytes(secret)]);
contractAddress = contract.address();

txnParams.lsig = contract;
await deployer.executeTx([txnParams]);
```

This time we will see a success message:

```
{
  'closing-amount': 999000,
  'confirmed-round': 24,
  'pool-error': '',
  txn: {
    lsig: { arg: [Array], l: [Uint8Array] },
    txn: {
      close: [Uint8Array],
      fee: 1000,
      fv: 22,
      gen: 'private-v1',
      gh: [Uint8Array],
      lv: 1022,
      snd: [Uint8Array],
      type: 'pay'
    }
  }
}
```

# 5. Guides

Check our [PyTEAL guide](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/docs/guide/py-teal.md) that explains more about PyTEAL integration with `algob`.
It's worth to mention a functionality we drafted to pass template parameters from our JavaScript scripts into a PyTEAL code. Check the [External Parameters Support](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/docs/guide/py-teal.md#external-parameters-support) section to see how you can use it to interface with PyTEAL code, rather than changing the values in the PyTEAL code everytime.
