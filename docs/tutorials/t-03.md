# 1. Creating TEAL files

In the `algob` project structure, the TEAL and PyTEAL code files are always placed in the `/assets/**` directory:

```
algob project:
├── assets
│   ├── TEAL files
│   ├── PyTEAL files
├── scripts
│ ├── deploy.ts
│   ├── run.ts
├── package.json
```

## Example

We will create a simple stateful smart contract which will:

- Have a global variable `counter`
- Will increment `counter` each time we call the application.

Full example can be found [here](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/tree/master/examples/stateful-counter/)

!!! info
_Stateful smart contracts_ are now referred as simply _smart contracts_.

# 2. Create a file with Approval Program

We will create a [approval program](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/assets/approval_program.teal) which has global `counter` and it is incremented when we call the application. Put the code below in `/assets/approval_program.teal`:

```
#pragma version 2

int NoOp
txn OnCompletion
==

bnz application_call

int 1
return

application_call:

// read global state
byte "counter"
dup
app_global_get

// increment the value
int 1
+

// store to scratch space
dup
store 0

// update global state
app_global_put

// load return value as approval
load 0
return

```

This program has a single global key/value pair to store the number of times the program was called. The key is the string "counter" and the value will be defined as an integer when the application is created.

# 3. Create a file with Clear Program

Now, we will create [clear program](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/assets/clear_program.teal). This program does not evaluate any conditions and simply approves the call. Put the code below in `/assets/clear_program.teal`:

```
#pragma version 2

int 1
return
```

# 4. Deploy New Application

To deploy the contract use the following code in a new [file](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/deploy.js) named `deploy.js` in `scripts` folder of your project directory:

### Create user accounts

```javascript
const masterAccount = deployer.accountsByName.get("master-account");
const creatorAccount = deployer.accountsByName.get("alice");

const algoTxnParams = {
	type: types.TransactionType.TransferAlgo,
	sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
	fromAccount: masterAccount,
	toAccountAddr: creatorAccount.addr,
	amountMicroAlgos: 20e6,
	payFlags: {},
};
// transfer some algos to creator account
await deployer.executeTx([algoTxnParams]);
```

In the code above we declare user accounts and fund `creatorAccount` account. `masterAccount` is the default account used in algob private net.

### Deploy stateful contract

Firstly we need to put some money into the contract. `master` account will fund it:

```javascript
// Create Application
// Note: An Account can have maximum of 10 Applications.
const appInfo = await deployer.deployApp(
  creatorAccount,
	{
    appName: "CounterApp"
    metaType: types.MetaType.FILE
	  	approvalProgramFilename: "approval_program.teal", // approval program
	  	clearProgramFilename: "clear_program.teal", // clear program
		localInts: 1,
		localBytes: 1,
		globalInts: 1,
		globalBytes: 1,
	},
	{}
);

console.log(appInfo);
```

Parameters passed are:

- Approval Program
- Clear Program
- App(stateful smart contract application) arguments which includes sender and details for storage usage.
- Transaction parameters

- In above code we have deployed a new application.

- After deploying application you will get the following information on your terminal:

```
Created new app-id: 189
{
  creator: 'EDXG4GGBEHFLNX6A7FGT3F6Z3TQGIU6WVVJNOXGYLVNTLWDOCEJJ35LWJY',
  txID: 'BCP3ZKT26K2BEB475OMKQHOMBEFVWEHESRS3XMAWQEVASFP6JFUA',
  confirmedRound: 13899,
  appID: 189
}

```

# 5. Opt-In to Application

To Opt-In to an application use the following code in one of your [scripts](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/deploy.js) (in `./scripts`):

```
	await deployer.optInAccountToApp(creatorAccount, appInfo.appID, {}, {});
```

where `Account` is the account you want to opt-in and applicationID is application index.

# 6. Call Application

To call an application use the following code in one of your [scripts](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/interaction/call_application.js) (in `./scripts`):

```
	const tx = {
      type: types.TransactionType.CallApp,
      sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
      fromAccount: creatorAccount,
      appId: applicationID,
      payFlags: {}
    }

    await deployer.executeTx([tx]);
```

In `tx` there are following parameters:

- we set the type which is `CallApp` - Call to (stateful)smart contract
- set the sign to SecretKey
- provide fromAccount details
- provide application index of App
- provide payment flags. If any (fee, firstValid, lastvalid etc)

Calling application each time will increase the stateful counter by 1.
To view the global state of the application you can use the following code:

```
  // Retreive Global State
  let globalState = await readGlobalStateApp(deployer, creatorAccount.addr, applicationID);
  console.log(globalState);
```

Output:

```
[ { key: 'Y291bnRlcg==', value: { bytes: '', type: 2, uint: 2 } } ]
[ { key: 'Y291bnRlcg==', value: { bytes: '', type: 2, uint: 3 } } ]
```

here key 'Y291bnRlcg==' is converted form of `counter`.

# 7. Update Application

To update application you can use the code below in your [script](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/interaction/update_application.js):

```js
  const updatedRes = await deployer.updateApp(
		"CounterApp", // app name use for checkpoint
		creatorAccount,
		{}, // pay flags
		applicationID,
		{
			metaType: types.MetaType.FILE,
			approvalProgramFilename: 'new_approval.teal',
			clearProgramFilename: 'new_clear.teal'	
		},
		{}
	);
	console.log("Application Updated: ", updatedRes);
```

# 8. Delete Application

To delete application you can use the code below in your [script](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/stateful-counter/scripts/interaction/delete_application.js):

```
	const tx = {
      type: types.TransactionType.DeleteApp,
      sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
      fromAccount: creatorAccount,
      appId: applicationID,
      payFlags: {},
      appArgs: []
    }

    await deployer.executeTx([tx]);
```
