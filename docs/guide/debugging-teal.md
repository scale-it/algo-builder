# Debugging TEAL

Algorand provides the `tealdbg` command-line tool to launch an interactive session where a smart contract can be examined as the contract is being evaluated. The debugger supports both stateful and stateless smart contracts. You can debug individual transactions or group of transaction (eg atomic transfers). The debugger supports setting the specific context for debugging purposes, including transactions, round number, latest timestamp, balance records, etc. The debugger runs either local programs or accepts HTTP connections from remote evaluators configured to run with a remote debugger hook.

## Using TEAL debugger with algob

Creating transaction data (via `goal --dryrun-dump` or SDK) could be a lengthy process, especially when using a transaction group. `Algob` provides an easy way to use debugger: by simply supplying the transactions as an input to the `TealDbg` method (same transaction parameters that we supply to [executeTransaction](https://algobuilder.dev/api/algob/modules.html#executetransaction) to execute same transaction on network).

NOTE: You use the `TealDbg` method in an algob script, which can be run using `algob deploy`/`algob run` commands.

### Using dry run for debugging a TEAL program in an algob script

Algob provides the functionality to do a test run of a TEAL smart contract. This option is useful to capture a transaction in an output file with associated state of the smart contract. This allows testing the TEAL logic in a dry run which allows to step by step follow the TEAL execution and inspect transaction approval or rejection.

The _dry run_ response from the Algorand REST API includes disassembly, logic signature messages with PASS/REJECT, a signature trace, app call messages, and an app call trace.

NOTE: The _dry run_ REST API is only available on a node if it has been enabled in the node's configuration (`EnableDeveloperAPI` = true).
Example:
```js
// txnParams are the input transactions
const debugger = new Tealdbg(deployer, txnParam);
await debugger.dryRunResponse('dryrun.json');
```

The _dry run_ Response will be dumped to `assets/dryrun.json`.

### Starting a debugging session

Instead of a _dry run_ execution, you can also start a debugging session (for example, with Chrome Developer Tools) in an `algob` script. This is helpful for setting up breakpoints in code, inspecting state after line by line execution etc.

Following params could be passed to debugger context:
* `tealFile`: Name of teal file (present in `assets/`) to pass to debugger.
* `mode`: Execution mode, either signature or application. Matches to Algod's evaluation mode for logic signature TEAL or application call TEAL. Read more about execution modes [here](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/cmd/tealdbg/README.md#execution-mode).
* `--group-index`: In case of a transaction group, group index should be passed to specify the current transaction in group in a debugger session.

**NOTE:** Passing `tealFile` is *optional*, but *recommended*. If not passed, debugger is run with the decompiled version of teal code. Supplying the program will allow debugging the original source and not the decompiled version.

```js
// txnParams are the input transactions
const debugger = new Tealdbg(deployer, txnParam);
await debugger.run({ tealFile: '4-gold-asa.teal' }); // 4-gold-asa.teal present in assets/**/
```

NOTE: To configure the chrome listener for a debugging session, read [Configure the Listener](https://github.com/algorand/go-algorand/blob/master/cmd/tealdbg/README.md#configure-the-listener).

## Example Walkthrough (Stateless TEAL)

In this section we will try to debug a stateless transaction in [`/examples/asa`](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/tree/master/examples/asa).

The smart contract used is [4-gold-asa.teal](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/asa/assets/teal/4-gold-asa.teal) which ensures:
+ Transaction type is asset transfer and AssetAmount <= 1000.
+ Sender is `goldOwner` account.

First we need to deploy the contracts using `algob deploy`. We will debug a transaction defined in [`scripts/transfer/gold-delegated-lsig.js`](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/asa/scripts/transfer/gold-delegated-lsig.js).

### Dry Run
Setting up transaction params (note that this is a passing scenario as amount = 500 <= 1000):
```js
// load signed lsig from checkpoint
const lsigGoldOwner = deployer.getDelegatedLsigByFile('4-gold-asa.teal');
const txnParam = {
  type: types.TransactionType.TransferAsset,
  sign: types.SignType.LogicSignature,
  fromAccountAddr: goldOwner.addr,
  toAccountAddr: john.addr,
  amount: 500,
  assetID: 'gold',
  lsig: lsigGoldOwner,
  payFlags: { totalFee: 1000 }
};
```
After setting up the transaction, let's try to execute dry run by adding the following lines to the script:
```
const debug = new Tealdbg(deployer, txnParam);
await debug.dryRunResponse('dryrun-pass.json');
```

It will create a `assets/dryrun-pass.json` file, which looks like (notice the logic-sig-message is PASS):
```

            }
          ]
        },
        ...
```

### Starting a debugging session

Let's try to launch a new debugger session with the same txnParam as in the above section:

```js
await debug.run({ tealFile: '4-gold-asa.teal' });
```

This will start a new debugger session. Console looks like:
```bash

Now, we have a remote target set up in `chrome://inspect`

Click on **inspect** and start playing with the teal code!

Script used in this walkthrough is `gold-delegated-lsig.debug.js` and can be found [here](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/develop/examples/asa/scripts/transfer/gold-delegated-lsig.debug.js).

## Example Walkthrough (Stateful TEAL)

In this section we will try to debug a stateful transaction (in a group) in [`/examples/permissioned-token-freezing`](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/tree/master/examples/permissioned-token-freezing).

There are 2 smart contracts (1 stateful & 1 stateless):
  * `poi-approval.teal`: Asserts a minimum level(stored in global state) set of a user. Rejects if assertion is failed.
  * `clawback-escrow.py`: A clawback account that is a stateless contract (lsig).
For more details, check the project [README](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/permissioned-token-freezing/README.md).

Setting up transaction group:
```js
// load app, asset info from checkpoint
const appInfo = deployer.getAppByFile('poi-approval.teal', 'poi-clear.teal');
const assetInfo = deployer.asa.get('gold');

// load logic signature
const escrowParams = {
  ASSET_ID: assetInfo.assetIndex,
  APP_ID: appInfo.appID
};
const escrowLsig = await deployer.loadLogicByFile('clawback-escrow.py', escrowParams);
const escrowAddress = escrowLsig.address();

const txGroup = [
  {
    type: types.TransactionType.CallApp,
    sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
    fromAccount: creator,
    appID: appInfo.appID,
    payFlags: { totalFee: 1000 },
    appArgs: ['str:check-level'],
    accounts: [bob.addr] //  AppAccounts
  },
  {
    type: types.TransactionType.RevokeAsset,
    sign: types.SignType.LogicSignature,
    fromAccountAddr: escrowAddress,
    recipient: bob.addr,
    assetID: assetInfo.assetIndex,
    revocationTarget: creator.addr,
    amount: 1000,
    lsig: escrowLsig,
    payFlags: { totalFee: 1000 }
  },
  {
    type: types.TransactionType.TransferAlgo,
    sign: types.SignType.SecretKey,
    fromAccount: creator,
    toAccountAddr: escrowAddress,
    amountMicroAlgos: 1000,
    payFlags: { totalFee: 1000 }
  }
];
```

In this group:
  * _tx0_ is an application call which checks minimum level of an account (in local state)
  * _tx1_ is an asset transfer transaction using a clawback lsig (_clawback-escrow.py_)
  * _tx2_ is an algo transfer transaction to pay fees of _tx1_

NOTE: Account's level can be set by executing [/permissioned-token-freezing/scripts/transfer/set-clear-level.js](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/examples/permissioned-token-freezing/scripts/transfer/set-clear-level.js). If a min level is set, then the dry run transaction will _PASS_, otherwise the "app-call-messages" would be _REJECT_.

### Dry Run

To get dry run response of the transaction group, simply do:
```js
// reponse is dumped to assets/dryrun.json
await debug.dryRunResponse('dryrun.json');
```

The dry run response has all 3 txns, with "app-call-messages"(PASS/REJECT) for _tx0_, and "logic-sig-messages" for _tx1_. Response will be `null` for _tx2_ (as this is a simple algo transfer tx).
As explained above, the message could be PASS/REJECT depending on the minlevel set.

### Start Debugger

To debug a specific transaction in a group, pass the `groupIndex` parameter. Let's try to start the debugger for _tx0_:
```js
await debug.run({ tealFile: "poi-approval.teal", groupIndex: 0 });
```

That's it, the code above will start a live debugging session.

Notice that in `Scope` we have `appGlobal`, `appLocals` as we upload the applications and ledger state while construcing request for `tealdbg debug`.

To debug 2nd transaction (clawbackLsig) in group, update the `tealFile` & `groupIndex`:
```js
await debug.run({
  tealFile: "clawback-escrow.py",
  scInitParam: escrowParams, // template paramters to pyTEAL file
  groupIndex: 1 // pass index of transaction to debug
});
```

This walkthrough can be found in [`/examples/permissioned-token-freezing/scripts/transfer/transfer-asset.debug.js`](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/develop/examples/permissioned-token-freezing/scripts/transfer/transfer-asset.debug.js)
