# [Algo Builder](https://algobuilder.dev/)

Algob is the CLI (Command Line Interface) for Algo Builder. Think about it as an Ethereum Truffle but for Algorand projects.

This package provides a variety of high level functions like, `executeTransaction`, `mkTxParams`, `Deployer`, etc. These functions help in making the development phase of algorand applications easier by acting as a middleware between the developer and `algosdk`.

Please read the main [README](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/README.md) file for details about the project and `algob`. This file provides a development description about the `algob` package.

## Using algob

`algob` can be included as a library using `yarn add @algo-builder/algob` and then import it using `import * from '@algo-builder/algob'` or can be run from command line as described in the project [README](https://github.com/scale-it/algo-builder/blob/master/README.md) file.

For a webapps, you should use [@algo-builder/web](https://algobuilder.dev/api/web/index.html) package, which is used by algob.

### Command line usage

`algob` always starts for checking and loading `algob.config.js` file. The config file will be generated (in the current directory) if not present in the project tree.

Help
`algob help`

View version
`algob --version`

Launch a node project console
`algob console`

## Contributing

When working on `algob`, we use CLI directly from the build directory using the following command:

    yarn run algob:dev

It will create a `project-dev` directory as a copy of the template project (`sample-project`).
In that directory you should update the `config.algob.js`. The `algob:dev` command will run all `algob` in that directory.

Also, it my be helpful to link the binary:

    yarn link
